🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

Redis won't start?
  → Check if already running: ps aux | grep redis
  → Check port not in use: lsof -i :6380
  → Try different port: redis-server --port 6381

Tests failing?
  → Clear test DB: dropdb smscrm_test && createdb smscrm_test
  → Re-run migrations: pnpm run migrate
  → Check mocks: Verify Twilio mocked

API 500 errors?
  → Check logs in Sentry (when enabled)
  → Verify DB connection: psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U postgres smscrm
  → Check .env file has all required vars

Build failing?
  → Clear cache: rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install
  → Check TS errors: pnpm run build
  → Verify versions: node --version (should be 20+)
