- Step-by-step instructions
- When things go wrong, what to do
- Daily routines
- Success metrics

### Step 2: Start Monday Morning (Week 1, Day 1)

THE_PLAN tells you exactly what to do:

**8:00 AM: Setup**
```bash
git checkout -b week1-redis-fix
redis-server --port 6380 --daemonize yes
```

**9:00 AM: Fix Session Service**
- Open apps/api/src/services/session.service.ts
- Fix callback-based promises (code example in THE_PLAN)
- Test locally

**10:30 AM: Enable Sessions**
- Uncomment line in apps/api/src/index.ts
- Start API and verify

...and so on for entire 6 weeks.

### Step 3: Execute with Discipline

**Don't skip steps.**
**Don't cut corners.**
**Trust the process.**

When tempted to rush:
- Remember: 4-week plan = 15% success

**THE_PLAN says:**
"Wednesday 9:00 AM: Create vitest.config.ts with this exact content: [code example]. Then create apps/api/src/__tests__/setup.ts with: [code example]. Then write these 5 specific tests: [list]. Budget 5 hours because you'll need to debug test database cleanup."
